- ## PREREQUISITE : Dijkstra 
- ### Question Explanation :
  A directed Weighted Graph and a Source Vertex is Given . Now From Source vertex to a Particular vertex there can be multiple Paths . But We need to find the Maximum Edge weight
  presented in such path . We need to Find Maximum Edge weight in path from Source to every vertex in a graph . Let us Give a Example , <br><br>
